# pmhc-mds
The [Primary Mental Health Care - Minimum Data Set (PMHC-MDS)](https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/) describes a standard for collecting data about primary mental health service provision. Its objective is to enable consistent reporting and monitoring of services funded by the Australian Government and delivered via commissioning by the Primary Health Networks. More information about the PMHC-MDS is available [here](https://pmhc-mds.com/).

This repo is a project to create an open-source Flask application to collect the PMHC-MDS. The aims of this project are to:

* Provide a codebase for a secure and reliable application that can be deployed by an organisation into a live environment.
* Create an opportunity for innovating, both in UX and data modelling. 
* Create an opportunity for a healthcare organisation to develop inhouse skills for web application development.
